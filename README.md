# Gradient-Descent-for-Linear-and-Logistic-Regression

In this Repository, I have added the comparison for Linear Regression and Logistic Regression using SkLearn and using Gradient Descent
Boston Dataset was used for Linear Regression with target variable as house prices
Titanic data was used for Logistic Regression with the categorical output value of wether the person survived or not
